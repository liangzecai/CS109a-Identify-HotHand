    "To answer if Hot Hand Theory is true or not based on our data, we first replicated the work that was done by Gilovich, Vallone and Tsersky (1985), looking at the conditional probability of making a hit after hit(s) or miss(es). Assumining shots were chosen randomly, the probability of making a hit after a hit streak should be higher than the probability of making a hit after a miss streak, if Hot Hand Theory is true.\n",

In real life, it is possible that as a player heats up, the defense gets tighter or the player starts making riskier shots as he feels more confident, both of which would mask the effect of \"hot-hand\". As a result, we consider modeling for the difficulty of each shot, and take the shot difficulty into account.\n",

As the figure shows, the predicted P(hit) between 0.2 to 0.8 agrees really well with the acutal hit percentage. Since the majority of shots fall within this range, we believe the predicted P(hit) the mojority of our data is reliable."

    "The predicted P(hit) serves as a proxy for shot difficulty, which is used to calculate adjusted conditional probability. An analogy to how the adjusted probability is calculated is similar to correcting an unfair coin. For example, consider an unfair coin which shows head 30% of the time and tail 70% of the time. If for this coin, every time a head appears, I count it as 0.7 and if tail appears, 0.3, the adjusted expected value of getting a head or a tail would be around 0.5, as if the coin is fair.\n",

Interesting, Klay Thompson, who recently scored 60 points within 29 minutes shows signs of hot hand when the probability is conditioned on one hit and two hits, in comparison with one miss and two misses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For future direction, we would like to explore more players and also collect for more data on players like Klay Thompson, as it is possible that Hot Hand is more porminent on certain players than others. We also need to figure out if the 1% difference of the conditioned P(hit) for Thompson is significant or not."
